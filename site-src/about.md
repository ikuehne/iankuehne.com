I am a Caltech computer science student and programmer, living in Pasadena,
California.  My interests include CS theory, math, programming languages, and
teaching programming.  Less seriously, I climb, run, and read history.

About this website
------------------

This website is intended as a blog, a portfolio, and an exercise in front-end
development with HTML/CSS.  I do not pretend to be a web designer or a front-end
developer, and any feedback on this website is welcome; see my [contact
information](contact.html).  It is built using
[Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll), a static website generation library for
Haskell.  All code, including HTML templates and SASS/CSS, is hand-written by
me.
